Styling a Single Word
=====================

To style a single word, you have to use HTML :doc:`raw directive <Raw Directive>` so that you can in turn use the ``span`` element and apply an inline style to it.

.. raw:: html

  <p>This is a paragraph in which I want <span style="color:red;font-size:22px">you</span> to read.</p>
